# [Logd App](http://logd.co)

_v2_
- This is a complete rewrite of version 1: uses Meteor 1.3, es6 modules and more.

- This is a tool for quickly creating personal notes.
- Just create a note and start typing.
- Changes are auto-saved as you type.
- Notes support [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and basic HTML.
- Built with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
- All layout, styling, and widgets were built from scratch (ie not using Bootstrap, etc.)
- Here is an example of using the app to create an outline for a workshop:
